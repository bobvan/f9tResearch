baseline1	My F9T in the config I left it from previous experiments
baseline2	Same, just another run for reproducibility
baseline3	Same, just after power cycling F9T
baseline4	Same, with factory reset via CFG-RST, but no clearing of Flash and BBR keys
baseline5	Same, with factory reset via CFG-RST and clearing of Flash and BBR keys
fixedPos1   First working fixed position, immediately after failed attempts
fixedPos2   Factory reset, then fixed position
fixedL1ca1  Fixed position, only GPS L1 C/A signal enabled, run 1
fixedL1ca2  Fixed position, only GPS L1 C/A signal enabled, run 2 for reproducibility
fixedL1l51  Fixed position, only GPS L1 C/A and L5 signals enabled, run 1
fixedL1l52  Same, but running two F9Ts, but timestamps from ptBoat were wrong
fixedL1l53  Same, but with fixed clock on ptBoat, long run
