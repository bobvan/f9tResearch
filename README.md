I set out to understand the limits of clock sync precision using GNSS signals.
The u-blox F9T receiver modules were the choice for my homelab.

This repo has the Python code I used to configure a pair of
F9Ts for precision timing and collect results.
It also includes the Jupyter notebooks I used for analysis.

This is not polished code that's ready to immediately solve poblems
for others.
It's a snapshot of my research tools that might be useful to
others with similar interests, but likely only with some adaptation.

I gave a [presentation summarizing my research](https://github.com/bobvan/lastNs2utc) at industry conferences.
