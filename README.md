I set out to understand the limits of clock sync precision using GNSS signals. The u-blox F9T receiver modules were the choice for my homelab.

This repo has the Python code I used to configure a pair of F9Ts for precision timing and collect results. It also includes the Jupyter notebooks I used for analysis.

I gave a [presentation summarizing my research](https://github.com/bobvan/lastNs2utc) at industry conferences.
